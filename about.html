      <h1> About </h1>
      <p>This project, undertaken by Brandon Hauck and Isai Torres Garcia of the Bachelor of Electronic Systems Engineering program at Conestoga College, revolves around the design and implementation of a sophisticated elevator control system. Leveraging the theoretical knowledge acquired from our software engineering and data communications courses, our team aims to develop a fully operational elevator system enhanced with a unique feature and remote accessibility.</p>  

      <p>The core objective is to create a Linux-based system that integrates multiple programming languages, including C++, HTML, JavaScript, and Python. This diverse technological stack will be utilized to develop both the front-end and back-end components of a web-based user interface. This interface will enable remote control and monitoring of the elevator, ensuring a seamless user experience.</p>  
          
      <p>The project involves intricate hardware integration where the team will meticulously assemble and test the necessary circuitry according to detailed wiring schematics. This hardware setup will support the overall functionality of the elevator system, including safety and operational efficiency.</p>  
          
      <p>A pivotal element of our project is the development of a robust database system. This system will store user data, CAN (Controller Area Network) logs, and critical diagnostic information, which will be vital for real-time monitoring and maintenance of the elevator.</p>  
          
      <p>Our collaborative efforts will be documented and managed using GitHub, facilitating version control and project tracking. This platform will not only host our code but also serve as a repository for project documentation and testing results, ensuring a comprehensive project lifecycle management.</p>  
          
      <p>Upon completion, the project is expected to deliver a fully functional, remotely controlled elevator system that exemplifies the integration of advanced software solutions with practical hardware applications, demonstrating our proficiency in both domains</p>
